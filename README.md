sequel
======

sequel = SQL = another attempt at defining a DSL for generating SQL statements

Mainly, this is a personal experiment.  It's also a wish list for what I'd love to see:

* A front-end syntax for creating SQL statements as values
  * Resembles SQL itself
  * Lets you define objects and the relationships between them
* A set of well-defined data structures for each kind of statement
* A back-end transformation to convert SQL values to SQL strings suitable to pass on to JDBC
* Support for vendor-specific transformations
* Clear separation of the front-end and back-end where the data itself is the only connection between the two
