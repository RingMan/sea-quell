= Seaquell To Do

There are some fairly powerful abilities but I don't remember them when too
much time goes by. In general, show more examples and write more tests to show
the usage.

== Docs

Add TOC directive to readme and home, especially.

* Usage
 ** Explain how to `require`
 ** Statements
  *** Explain select, select$, select! trio
  *** Explain sql, sql$, sql! trio
  *** Explain use of `db` and `params` and JDBC options
  *** Every stmt link to SQLite syntax, tests, or examples
  *** Compound select
  *** Values
 ** Expressions
* Reference
 ** Statements (link to tests or examples)
  *** list of fns for each statement. also try to list clause fns and property fns
 ** Modifying statements
  *** list of fns
 ** Representation
  *** Expressions
  *** Of statements
 ** Engine
 ** How code is organized
  *** Add page describing organization of source
  *** Add page describing the tests.
* Design
* Roadmap
 ** More docs
 ** Translate to intermediate rep
 ** User-defined dialect/engine
 ** Extensible clauses

== NOW!

 * Convert everything you can to cljc files
 * Replace wiki docs with docs folder. Keep in sync with code. Make it work
   with cljdocs
 * I just realized that regex is not a general solution to raw unescaped SQL.
   You can't just hold arbitrary strings in a regex. The problems start when
   you want to use regex metacharacters in your string.
 * maybe add a seaquell.frags namespace with all the upper case frags
 * add ALL, DISTINCT frags
 * Add specs for vacuum statement
 * Add specs, tests for analyze statement
 * vacuum can't run in a transaction. maybe let engine take care of it
 * Pull in sqlite namespace from NmwsNgJni project
   ** write sqlite util fn to get value of pragma
   ** add fns to show triggers, indices, views, or subset of entities
 * Integrate experimental raw sql vectors
   ** Let it be arg of `raw` function
   ** Pass it to `sql!` function as a vector

== upsert

 * perhaps add core tests for the on-conflict clause
 * perhaps add rendering tests for the on-conflict clause in upsert-test

== the dev branch

 * master branch
  ** include sql zoo stuff
  ** include order term stuff
 * dev branch
  ** syntax stuff
  ** raw stuff
  ** upsert stuff
  ** notes

== Grab db and params from statement for explain

When `explain!` is executed, use `db` and `params` from the target statement as
defaults to improve usability in REPL sessions.

Make sure to document and/or show tests/examples that use the defaults

== Show use of with clause inside call to select

 (select ... (with ...))

== Fix exec fn (done)

 * for select and compound-select queries containing a with clause (done)
 * add tests demonstrating WITH clause and compound selects
 * add tests demonstrating with$
 * add tests demonstrating with! and mixing in `db` and `params` to the final
   select
 * add tests with union!, intersect!, etc and mixing in `db` and `params`.

== Boolean TRUE, FALSE

Check if TRUE and FALSE aliases are supported by DSL.

== Goals

The overall goal is to provide complete coverage for sqlite. However, there is
a progression:

 * SELECT
  ** Window functions
  ** Row values
  ** Full ORDER BY support
 * INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
 * UPSERT
 * EXPLAIN, EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
 * ATTACH, DETACH
 * CREATE, ALTER TABLE, DROP
 * Transactions
 * Other

Other databases:

 * H2
 * Apache Derby
 * HSQLDB
 * PostgreSQL
 * MySQL
 * MariaDB
 * Microsoft SQL Server
 * Microsoft Access
 * Oracle
 * DB2
 * etc

=== Fill in SQLite Gaps

Support the features listed in https://sqlite.org/omitted.html

 * RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOIN
 * Complete ALTER TABLE support
 * Complete TRIGGER support
 * Writing to VIEWs (if it needs any extra syntax)
 * GRANT and REVOKE

== UPSERT Statement

The UPDATE part is a subset of the regular UPDATE statement. Change how the
function processes its first argument. Allow :source to be nil.

== Use clojure.spec to document and validate data structures

Write a function spec for exec fn in engine

Use multi-spec for statements

== Raw SQL

When using maps to represent entities, it's most challenging to try and insert
raw SQL between clauses.

 * Use tests to show usage and coverage of `raw`
 * Integrate experimental raw sql vectors

It is a goal of this project to provide DSL syntax to express any SQLite
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.

The EXPLAIN statements also have DSL support.

Statements that are simple will likely have eventual DSL support. However, for
more complicated statements, it isn't always clear what clauses it would have
and how to define syntax for those. I envision that each statement will have a
corresponding function to create it, but much of the SQL "body" will be
espressed using raw SQL.

It is also a goal to allow users to create any SQL statement of any dialect
without having to resort to strings as a last resort.

== Full Coverage Examples and Tests

For each supported construct, want enough tests and examples to provide 100%
coverage of the syntax diagrams. This is immensely useful

Make sure there are good examples on compound-select. I really like the DSL,
but it's not obvious how to use it at first.  Once you see examples, however,
the syntax makes a lot of sense and feels very natural.

With clauses also deserve special attention. There are already two insane
examples, but could also use some simpler ones.

Window functions will also need plenty of coverage.

Same is true for expressions, provide examples of every possible type. Cover
the whole syntax tree.

== Explain Statement Creation, Rendering, Execution Trilogy

Make it very clear about select, select$, select! variations of each
statement.

Also show use of to-sql, do-sql, sql$, and sql!.

Show use of db and params and how they can live in a query definition or be
tacked on easily later.

Should there be with$ and with! as well? I think maybe so.  Anything that
could act as a top-level SQL command.

Show or explain use of pass-through options to jdbc.

 * Use of db
 * Use of params
 * Use of :row-fn :result-set-fn and other opts passed to jdbc


== Show Value and Values Examples

Make it clear that it can be used as a top-level select statement. In
particular, show use of `value` with the :-- option to set the db:

 (value! 1 2 3 :-- (db conn))
 (value! 1 2 :? :-- (db conn) (params 3))
 (values! [1 2] [3 4] (db conn))

 (sql! (value 1 2 3) (db conn))
 (sql! (value 1 2 :?) (db conn) (params 3))
 (sql! (values [1 2] [3 4]) (db conn))

== Show How to use Row Values

Show examples of using row values based on https://sqlite.org/rowvalue.html

Row values are usable in update statements, but they have to be wrapped in a
map because set-cols uses mk-map* under the hood.

This doesn't work:

 (set [val :x :y] [val 1 2])

This does:

 (set {[val :x :y] [val 1 2]})

== Add Help in REPL

Perhaps add help fn that lists groups of fns for certain things.

 user> (help) ; give help on help
 user> (help :statements) ; give help on statements in general
 user> (help :select-core) ; give help on core select as defined by sqlite
 user> (help :compound-select) ; give help on compound select usage
 user> (help :select) ; give help on a particular statement
 user> (help :fields) ; give help on selecting fields
 user> (help :expressions) ; give help on defining expressions
 user> (help :literals) ; give help on literals in expressions
 user> (help :parameters) ; give help on defining expressions
 user> (help :join) ; give help on joins
 user> (help :with) ; give help on with
 user> (help :window) ; give help on window functions
 user> (help :predicates) ;show available predicate fns
 user> (help :edit) ;show available edit fns
 user> (help :transactions) ;show available edit fns
 user> (help :exec) ;how to execute queries with and without results
 user> (help :render) ;how to render queries to a SQL string
 user> (help :ast :<some-construct>) ;describe spec for some SQL construct

== Convert to jdbc.next

Probably want to do this or provide execution protocols to use either the
original or the next seamlessly.
