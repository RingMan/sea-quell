How to write SQL statements as sequences of tokens.

The <<../README.adoc#, README>> introduced you to this way of writing SQL.
I find it pretty easy to use, but there are a few tricks you'll need to know.

== The `sql` Function

To create raw SQL, just call the `sql` function with one or more arguments.

CAUTION: If for some reason your first token represents a string literal, wrap it in a vector.
Otherwise, `sql` will assume it's verbatim SQL, not a string literal.
In practice this almost never happens because SQL statements always start with a SQL keyword.

It's usually easiest to pass a quoted vector, so you can type symbols instead of keywords.

(sql :select :* :from :t \;)
(sql [:select :* :from :t \;])
(sql '[select * from t\;])
