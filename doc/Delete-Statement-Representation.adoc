= Delete Statement Representation
ifdef::env-github,env-cljdoc[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]
:idprefix:
:idseparator: -

Below is a map showing the structure of a _delete_ statement.
The first two keys are required.

[source,clojure]
----
{:sql-stmt :delete
 :source ...name...
 :as ...name...
 :indexed-by ...name-or-nil...
 :where ...expr...
 :order-by ...order-item-list...
 :limit ...expr...
 :offset ...expr...}
----

== FROM Clause

`+...source...+` is the table _name_ (required)

`+...as...+` is an optional alias

`:indexed-by` is an optional index _name_

Here's how `:indexed-by` would be used...

[source,clojure]
----
{:source :tbl}
;; FROM tbl
{:source :tbl :indexed-by nil}
;; FROM tbl NOT INDEXED
{:source :tbl :indexed-by :ix}
;; FROM tbl INDEXED BY ix
----

== Other Clauses

The remaining clauses have the same meaning as in <<Select-Statement-Representation.adoc#, select statements>>.

https://www.sqlite.org/lang_delete.html#optional_limit_and_order_by_clauses[SQLite] optionally allows ORDER BY, LIMIT and OFFSET clauses, but they may not be standard SQL.
